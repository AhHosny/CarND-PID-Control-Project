# Overview

This project implements a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) to control a car in Udacity's simulator([it could be downloaded here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)). The simulator sends cross-track error, speed and angle to the PID controller(PID) using [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) and it receives the steering angle ([-1, 1] normalized) and the throttle to drive the car. The PID uses the [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) WebSocket implementation. Udacity provides a seed project to start from on this project ([here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project)).

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Compilation

The code compiles without errors or warnings. No modifications were done on the provided setup.

## Implementation

The PID implementation is done on the [./src/PID.cpp](./src/PID.cpp). The [PID::UpdateError](./src/PID.cpp#L33) method calculates proportional, integral and derivative errors and the [PID::TotalError](./src/PID.cpp#L55) calculates the total error using the appropriate coefficients.

## Reflection

- The proportional portion of the controller tries to steer the car toward the center line (against the cross-track error). If used along, the car overshoots the central line very easily and go out of the road very quickly. 

- The integral portion tries to eliminate a possible bias on the controlled system that could prevent the error to be eliminated. If used along, it makes the car to go in circles. In the case of the simulator, no bias is present.

- The differential portion helps to counteract the proportional trend to overshoot the center line by smoothing the approach to it.

###  How the final hyperparameters were chosen.

The parameters were chosen manually by try and error. First, make sure the car can drive straight with zero as parameters. Then add the proportional and the car start going on following the road but it starts overshooting go out of it. Then add the differential to try to overcome the overshooting. The integral part only moved the car out of the road; so, it stayed as zero. After the car drove the track without going out of it, the parameters increased to minimize the average cross-track error on a single track lap. The final parameters where [P: 1.5, I: 0.0, D: 2.5].
